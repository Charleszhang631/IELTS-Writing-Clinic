## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

In today’s digital age, more and more parents are allowing their children to spend time on computers and tablets, believing that this will help them acquire valuable technology skills. While this development has its advantages, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits.

One clear advantage of children using computers and tablets is the opportunity to learn essential digital skills from an early age. As technology continues to shape every aspect of modern life, being proficient in digital tools is becoming a critical skill. Educational apps and games can also engage children in a fun and interactive way, enhancing their learning experience and fostering interest in subjects such as math, science, and language.

However, the downsides of prolonged screen time must not be overlooked. Excessive use of computers and tablets can lead to various health issues, such as eye strain, headaches, and poor posture. Children who spend too much time on screens may also become sedentary, which can contribute to long-term physical problems like obesity. Additionally, overexposure to screens can negatively affect children's social development. Relying heavily on digital devices can reduce their ability to communicate effectively with peers and may lead to poor social skills.

In conclusion, while allowing children to use computers and tablets provides certain educational benefits, the negative impacts on their health and social development are significant. Therefore, it is crucial for parents to monitor and limit their children's screen time to ensure a balanced approach to both technology use and overall well-being.

## 🌏 中文翻译

在当今的数字时代，越来越多的家长允许孩子使用电脑和平板，认为这能帮助他们学习有价值的技术技能。虽然这种做法有其优势，但我认为其弊大于利。

孩子使用电脑和平板的一个明显优势是他们有机会从小学习重要的数字技能。随着科技影响现代生活的方方面面，熟练掌握数字工具已成为一项关键技能。教育类应用程序和游戏还能以有趣且互动的方式吸引孩子，增强他们的学习体验，激发他们对数学、科学和语言等学科的兴趣。

然而，长时间使用电子设备带来的负面影响也不容忽视。过度使用电脑和平板会导致视力疲劳、头痛和不良姿势等健康问题。花太多时间在屏幕前还可能导致孩子缺乏运动，这会增加他们患上肥胖等长期身体问题的风险。此外，过度依赖电子设备还可能对孩子的社交发展产生负面影响。过多依赖数字设备可能削弱他们与同龄人有效沟通的能力，导致社交技能的不足。

总之，尽管允许孩子使用电脑和平板在教育方面有一定的好处，但其对健康和社交发展的负面影响十分显著。因此，家长应该监控并限制孩子的屏幕使用时间，以确保科技使用与全面健康发展之间的平衡。
