## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

During the 20th century, contacts between different parts of the world developed rapidly due to air travel and telecommunications. The increased contact through international tourism and business has brought significant changes to societies. This essay will explore the extent to which societies have benefited from these closer relationships.

On the one hand, increased international tourism and business have contributed positively to economic growth. Tourism brings foreign visitors, which leads to an influx of spending in local economies, boosting sectors like hospitality, transportation, and retail. Similarly, international business fosters foreign investment, encourages innovation, and creates job opportunities. These economic benefits are particularly important for developing nations that rely heavily on tourism and foreign capital for growth. In addition, increased contact between countries promotes cultural understanding. People are exposed to new cultures, traditions, and perspectives, which can break down stereotypes and foster global cooperation. This cultural exchange helps to bridge differences and promote peace between nations.

On the other hand, there are challenges associated with increased global contact. One issue is the risk of cultural homogenization. As global tourism and business expand, dominant cultures may overshadow local traditions, leading to a loss of cultural diversity. Moreover, the economic benefits of globalization are not evenly distributed. While some regions thrive from international business and tourism, others may struggle to compete, leading to greater inequality between rich and poor nations.

In conclusion, societies have largely benefited from the increased contact and closer relationships brought about by international tourism and business. However, it is essential to address the challenges of cultural erosion and economic disparity to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared more equitably.

## 🌍 中文翻译

在20世纪，由于航空旅行和电信技术的发展，全球各地的联系迅速发展。通过国际旅游和商业活动带来的密切联系为社会带来了显著变化。本文将探讨这些关系在多大程度上为社会带来了好处。

一方面，国际旅游和商业活动对经济增长作出了积极贡献。旅游业吸引了外国游客，带来了大量消费，推动了当地经济的发展，特别是在酒店业、交通和零售业方面。同样，国际商业促进了外资流入、鼓励了创新，并创造了就业机会。这些经济利益对依赖旅游业和外国资本发展的国家尤其重要。此外，国家间的联系增加促进了文化理解。人们接触到新的文化、传统和观点，有助于打破刻板印象，促进全球合作。文化交流有助于弥合国家间的差异，促进和平。

另一方面，全球联系增加也带来了一些挑战。其中一个问题是文化同质化的风险。随着全球旅游和商业的扩展，主流文化可能会掩盖本地传统，导致文化多样性的丧失。此外，全球化带来的经济利益并非均匀分布。一些地区从国际商业和旅游中获益颇丰，而其他地区则可能难以竞争，导致贫富国家之间的不平等加剧。

总之，社会从国际旅游和商业带来的密切关系中受益匪浅，尤其是在经济和文化理解方面。然而，解决文化侵蚀和经济不平等的问题至关重要，以确保全球化的好处能更公平地分配。
