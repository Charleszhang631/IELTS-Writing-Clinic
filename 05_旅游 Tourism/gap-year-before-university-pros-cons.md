## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

Many school leavers choose to travel or work before going directly to university. While this gap year offers valuable experiences, it can also have certain disadvantages for their studies. I believe that, although there are benefits, the drawbacks may outweigh them in some cases.

On the one hand, taking a gap year can provide students with practical experience. Working or traveling allows students to encounter real-world situations and develop skills that are not taught in the classroom. These experiences can enhance their communication, social, and problem-solving abilities, which will be beneficial during their university studies and future careers. Moreover, a gap year can help students become more independent and responsible. Managing their own time, finances, and decisions during work or travel makes them more mature and prepared for university life.

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to delaying university. First, students may lose their academic momentum during a gap year. After a long break from studying, they may find it difficult to re-adjust to the academic environment, especially if they have not engaged in any educational activities during that time. Additionally, some students may become too comfortable with the freedom and flexibility of working or traveling, making it harder for them to focus on their long-term academic goals once they return to school.

In conclusion, while a gap year can offer valuable life experiences and skills, it may also have a negative impact on academic progress. Students should weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully before deciding whether to take a break before university.

## 🌍 中文翻译

许多高中毕业生选择在直接进入大学之前先去旅行或工作。虽然这种间隔年提供了宝贵的经历，但它对学业也有一些不利影响。我认为，尽管有一定的好处，但在某些情况下，缺点可能超过了优势。

一方面，间隔年可以为学生提供实践经验。工作或旅行让学生接触到现实世界，并发展课堂上无法教授的技能。这些经历能提升他们的沟通能力、社交能力和解决问题的能力，这些在大学和未来职业生涯中都是非常有用的。此外，间隔年还能帮助学生变得更加独立和负责任。在工作或旅行中管理自己的时间、财务和决策，让他们在进入大学生活前更加成熟。

另一方面，推迟上大学也存在一些不利之处。首先，学生在间隔年期间可能会失去学术节奏。在长时间没有接触学术学习之后，重返校园时他们可能会感到不适应，特别是在间隔年期间没有进行任何学习活动时。此外，一些学生可能过于习惯于工作或旅行中的自由和灵活性，回到学校后可能难以集中精力追求长期的学术目标。

总之，虽然间隔年可以提供宝贵的生活经验和技能，但它也可能对学业进展产生负面影响。学生在做出是否在上大学前休息一年的决定时，应仔细权衡其中的利弊。
