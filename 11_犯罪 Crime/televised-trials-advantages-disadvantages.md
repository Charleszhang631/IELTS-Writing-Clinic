## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

In some countries, criminal trials are shown on television, allowing the general public to watch them. While this practice has certain benefits, it also raises significant concerns. I believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

One of the main benefits of televising trials is the promotion of judicial transparency. By broadcasting trials, the public gains insight into how the legal process functions, which can build trust in the system and reduce the likelihood of corruption or wrongful convictions. Public exposure to these procedures can also serve as an educational tool, increasing legal literacy and encouraging respect for the rule of law.

However, the drawbacks of this practice are notable. The most concerning issue is the violation of the defendant's privacy. Broadcasting a trial can expose sensitive details about the accused before any verdict is reached, causing damage to their reputation. Even if found not guilty, the stigma of public scrutiny can be difficult to erase. Additionally, the presence of media and the potential for public pressure may affect the impartiality of judges and juries, undermining the fairness of the trial process. This external influence can lead to biased outcomes, compromising the principle of fair justice.

In conclusion, while televising criminal trials can enhance transparency and educate the public, the potential harm to the defendant's privacy and the risk of compromising trial fairness are more significant. Thus, this practice should be approached cautiously, ensuring that judicial transparency does not come at the expense of individual rights or the integrity of legal proceedings.

## 🌏 中文翻译

在一些国家，刑事审判会在电视上公开播出，公众可以观看。尽管这种做法有其优点，但也引发了重要的担忧。我认为，弊大于利。

公开审判的主要好处之一是促进司法透明。通过播放审判，公众可以了解法律程序的运作，这有助于增强对司法系统的信任，减少腐败或误判的可能性。审判公开还可作为教育工具，提高公众的法律知识，增强对法治的尊重。

然而，这一做法的缺点也很明显。最令人担忧的问题是侵犯被告的隐私。在判决前播出审判可能会暴露被告的敏感信息，损害其声誉。即使最终无罪释放，公众审视带来的污名也很难消除。此外，媒体的关注和公众的压力可能影响法官和陪审团的独立判断，削弱审判的公正性。这种外部影响可能导致偏见，破坏公正审判的原则。

总之，虽然公开审判能提高透明度并教育公众，但对隐私的潜在损害和审判公正性的风险更大。因此，应谨慎对待，确保司法公开不会以牺牲个人权利和法律程序完整性为代价。
