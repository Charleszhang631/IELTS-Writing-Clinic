## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

Interviews form the basic selection procedure for most large companies. However, some people believe that interviews are not always the most reliable method for selecting candidates, and there are better alternatives. I partly agree with this statement, as interviews have their strengths, but other methods can complement the process for more accurate hiring decisions.

On the one hand, interviews are an effective way for employers to assess candidates in person. They allow hiring managers to interact directly with applicants, observe their communication skills, assess their personality, and gauge how well they might fit into the company’s culture. Interviews also provide a quick way to narrow down a large pool of applicants and make initial judgments based on how candidates present themselves and respond to questions.

On the other hand, interviews have limitations. A candidate's performance in an interview may not always reflect their true abilities or how they will perform in a real work environment. Some candidates may struggle with nerves or stress, which could affect their ability to showcase their skills. Additionally, interviews often focus more on soft skills rather than technical competencies. Other methods, such as skills tests, work simulations, or group exercises, can provide a more practical and objective assessment of a candidate’s abilities and teamwork. These approaches allow employers to see how candidates perform in situations that closely mirror the actual job tasks.

In conclusion, while interviews are a useful tool in the selection process, they are not foolproof. Combining interviews with other evaluation methods, such as skills tests or job simulations, can lead to a more accurate and well-rounded assessment of a candidate’s suitability for a position.

## 🌏 中文翻译

面试是许多大公司招聘的基本程序。然而，有些人认为面试并不是最可靠的选拔方式，还有更好的替代方法。我部分同意这种观点，面试虽然有其优势，但其他方法可以补充这一过程，使招聘决策更加准确。

一方面，面试是雇主评估候选人的有效方式。通过面试，招聘经理可以直接与申请人互动，观察他们的沟通技巧，评估他们的个性，并判断他们是否适合公司的文化。面试还提供了一种快速筛选大量申请者的方法，雇主可以根据候选人的表现和对问题的回答做出初步的判断。

另一方面，面试也有局限性。候选人在面试中的表现不一定能反映他们的实际能力或在真实工作环境中的表现。有些候选人可能因为紧张或压力而无法充分展示自己的技能。此外，面试通常更多关注软技能，而非技术能力。其他评估方法，如技能测试、工作模拟或小组讨论，能够提供更实际和客观的评估，让雇主看到候选人在实际工作任务中的表现。

总之，尽管面试是招聘过程中的有用工具，但它并非完美无缺。结合其他评估方法，如技能测试或工作模拟，能够更准确和全面地评估候选人是否适合某个职位。
