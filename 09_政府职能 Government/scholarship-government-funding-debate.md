## ✍️ Sample Essay (English)

Some people believe that government funding should only provide scholarships for the best students, while all other funding should come from student fees or private organizations. I disagree with this view, as government funding should also support students from disadvantaged backgrounds to promote equal access to education.

On the one hand, limiting scholarships to the best students could encourage competition and academic excellence. By offering financial support to the top performers, the government can motivate students to work harder and strive for better academic results. Additionally, with limited resources, prioritizing funding for the best students ensures that government investments are directed toward individuals who are likely to achieve the highest returns, benefiting society as a whole.

However, only funding the best students could harm the fairness of the education system. Many capable students from lower-income families may not have access to the same opportunities as wealthier students, and relying solely on private funding or student fees could prevent them from pursuing higher education. Furthermore, academic excellence is not the only measure of a student’s potential. By offering broader access to scholarships, the government can support a diverse range of students, including those who show talent in areas that standardized tests may not capture, fostering a more well-rounded and inclusive society.

In conclusion, while supporting the best students through government funding is important, I believe the government should also provide scholarships to students from disadvantaged backgrounds to ensure education equity and social development. Both merit and need should be considered in scholarship distribution.

## 🌏 中文翻译

有些人认为，政府资助应该只为最优秀的学生提供奖学金，而其他学生应通过学费或私人资助来完成学业。我不同意这种观点，因为政府资助也应支持经济困难的学生，促进教育公平。

一方面，将奖学金限制给最优秀的学生可以鼓励竞争和学术卓越。通过为成绩最好的学生提供资助，政府可以激励学生更加努力学习，取得更好的学术成绩。此外，政府资源有限，优先为成绩优异的学生提供资助，确保投资能够用于那些可能取得最大回报的个人，有利于社会整体发展。

然而，只为优等生提供资助可能会损害教育体系的公平性。许多来自低收入家庭的有能力的学生可能无法像富裕家庭的学生一样获得相同的机会，依赖私人资助或学费可能使他们失去接受高等教育的机会。此外，学术成绩并不是衡量学生潜力的唯一标准。通过提供更广泛的奖学金，政府可以支持更多有才能的学生，包括那些在标准化考试中未能表现出潜力的学生，从而培养一个更全面和包容的社会。

总之，虽然通过政府资助支持最优秀的学生很重要，但我认为政府也应为贫困背景的学生提供奖学金，以确保教育公平和社会发展。奖学金分配应考虑学术成绩与经济需求。
