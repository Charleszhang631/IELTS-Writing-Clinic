## 📝 英文范文
Some people believe that companies and individuals, rather than governments, should bear the cost of cleaning up the pollution they have caused. While I agree that companies and individuals should take responsibility for the pollution they create, I believe the government also has a crucial role to play in regulating and ensuring the cleanup process.

On the one hand, companies and individuals should be held accountable for the environmental damage they cause. Making polluters pay for cleanup encourages them to adopt more sustainable practices and reduce their environmental impact. Companies, especially in industries that contribute significantly to industrial pollution, should be incentivized to invest in cleaner technologies and limit their waste and emissions.

On the other hand, the government plays a vital role in regulating and enforcing environmental policies. Many pollution problems, such as air and water contamination, are too large for individual companies to address alone. Governments have the capacity to manage large-scale environmental cleanup projects and ensure that those responsible for pollution contribute fairly to the costs. Moreover, through tax policies or environmental laws, governments can ensure that all polluters contribute to the solution rather than relying on voluntary actions.

However, relying solely on companies and individuals to fund pollution cleanup can lead to shirking responsibility. In some cases, it is difficult to track down the sources of pollution, and companies may try to evade their financial obligations. Additionally, many environmental issues, such as air pollution or water contamination, are global or regional problems that require coordinated action beyond the capabilities of individual polluters.

In my opinion, the responsibility for pollution cleanup should be shared between companies, individuals, and the government. While companies and individuals should be held accountable for their environmental impact, the government must create the necessary legislation and oversight to ensure pollution is managed effectively. Governments can implement pollution taxes or similar measures to ensure that those responsible for pollution bear the costs, while also managing large-scale cleanup efforts.

In conclusion, companies and individuals should be primarily responsible for the pollution they cause, but the government also has a key role in regulating and coordinating the cleanup process. Only through a combined effort can pollution be effectively addressed, ensuring a sustainable environment for future generations.

有些人认为，公司和个人，而不是政府，应该为他们造成的污染支付清理费用。虽然我同意公司和个人应对他们产生的污染负责，但我认为政府在监管和确保清理过程中的作用同样至关重要。

一方面，公司和个人应该为他们造成的环境破坏承担责任。让污染者支付清理费用可以促使他们采用更加可持续的做法，减少对环境的影响。特别是那些对工业污染有重大贡献的行业，应该受到激励，投资于更清洁的技术，减少废物和排放。

另一方面，政府在监管和执行环保政策方面扮演着重要角色。许多污染问题（如空气和水污染）规模太大，单靠公司无法解决。政府有能力管理大规模的环境清理项目，确保那些造成污染的企业公平地承担费用。此外，通过税收政策或环境法律，政府可以确保所有污染者为解决方案作出贡献，而不是仅依靠自愿行为。

然而，完全依赖公司和个人支付清理费用可能导致推卸责任。在某些情况下，污染源难以追踪，公司可能会试图逃避其经济责任。此外，许多环境问题（如空气污染或水污染）是全球或区域性问题，需要超出单个污染者能力的协调行动。

我认为，污染清理的责任应由公司、个人和政府共同承担。虽然公司和个人应对其环境影响负责，但政府必须制定必要的立法和监督，以确保有效管理污染。政府可以实施污染税等措施，确保污染者承担费用，同时管理大规模的清理工作。

总之，公司和个人应该主要负责他们造成的污染，但政府在监管和协调清理过程中也起着关键作用。只有通过共同努力，才能有效解决污染问题，确保未来环境的可持续性。
